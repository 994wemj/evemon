These four files are direct from Microsoft.
However, until they fix the cock up they made of SP1 for Visual Studio's C++ Compiler we need them for those who don't have them on their system already.

The relevant files are:

msvcm80.dll 
msvcp80.dll <-- We don't think this one is needed, but have included it to be on the safe side
msvcr80.dll
Microsoft.VC80.CRT.manifest
