This Directory and it's contained files are direct from Logitech.

These are the core of the SDK for the G15 keyboards LCD, as such they are needed for the lgLCDNETWrapper.dll project (c++) that is used in EVEMon. Without these files that project will not build.

These files will also be needed for the lgLCDNetWrapper.dll once we can track down some source code for it.
